## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/and-or-gates.git
cd and-or-gates

Usage
The project includes two main functions: and_gate and or_gate. You can use these functions to simulate the behavior of AND and OR gates.

Example
Python

from gates import and_gate, or_gate

# AND gate example
result_and = and_gate(True, False)
print(f"AND Gate: True AND False = {result_and}")

# OR gate example
result_or = or_gate(True, False)
print(f"OR Gate: True OR False = {result_or}")
